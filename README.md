# My Personal Portfolio

#### A personal portfolio website made with React and Framer Motion for animations.

## Lessons Learned

My Third React project, really enjoyed the usage of hooks throughout the project.
I wanted to write everything manually from design to media queries
so i could learn from my mistakes which helped me immensely especially in the mobile design.

## Potential Future Features

- A third and fourth projects added to the list to better showcase my skills - DONE!
- A specifically made Particles.js background for the home page - Not needed anymore

Used Create-React-App for this project so to run locally

```
git clone
npm/yarn install
npm/yarn start
```

- Mostly Used Scss, Flexbox, Media-Queries for styling, layout and responsiveness, haven't used any css framework in this
- Used Framer Motion for majority of the animations
